# Spam Classifier Project

This project implements a spam classifier using machine learning techniques to differentiate between spam and legitimate messages. It leverages natural language processing (NLP) and supervised learning to classify text data.

## Dataset

The project uses a labeled dataset containing messages categorized as either "spam" or "ham" (legitimate). Preprocessing steps include text cleaning, tokenization, and feature extraction using techniques like bag-of-words or TF-IDF.

## Features

- **Text Preprocessing**: 
  - Removing stop words, punctuation, and special characters.
  - Tokenization and lowercasing.
- **Feature Engineering**:
  - Vectorization of text data using bag-of-words or TF-IDF.
- **Modeling**:
  - Supervised machine learning algorithms like Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or Support Vector Machines.
- **Evaluation**:
  - Model performance metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Installation
